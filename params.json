{"name":"Hydrostats","tagline":"Calculate hydrologic indices from daily streamflow data","body":"#Hydrostats\r\n\r\n hydrostats is a set of tools to compute streamflow indices commonly used in hydrology and ecology such as:\r\n- basic summary statistics\r\n- high spells (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing etc.)\r\n- low spells\r\n- cease-to-flow spells\r\n- Colwell's indices\r\n- partial series\r\n- baseflow components\r\n\r\n\t\r\nMost of the functions can be used with plyr to return a dataframe of indices based on an additional splitting factor. This allows the analysis (for example) of data from multiple gauges simultaneously, without the need to write a for loop. As well as summary indices, several functions will instead return a dataframe of individual spell charactersistics for use in subsequent analysis and plotting.\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\nTo install the latest development version run the following code: \r\n\r\n\t#install dependencies (devtools required only to install from Github)\r\n\tinstall.packages(c(\"plyr\", \"lubridate\", \"devtools\"))\r\n\r\n\t#install pacakge\r\n\tdevtools::install_github(\"nickbond/hydrostats\")\r\n\r\n\t# Remove the package zip after installation\r\n\tunlink(\"hydrostats.zip\")\r\n\r\n![Plot showing high spell events above the 10th percentile flow.](https://github.com/nickbond/hydrostats/blob/master/high_spells.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Developer\r\nNick Bond n.bond@griffith.edu.au","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
